# Demodulation of BFSK Signal
The goal of the project was to demodulate a modulated BFSK signal, first on MATLAB and then on 6748 DSK.TI TMS320C6748 DSK Board. A Digital Oscilloscope was used to compare outputs. The modulated signal will be generated on MATLAB using soundsc() function. The modulated signal from MATLAB will be fed as input to the DSK. A Kaiser Low Pass Filter was also implemented to separate the high frequency components. Kindly refer to the project report for further details and MATLAB output images.
